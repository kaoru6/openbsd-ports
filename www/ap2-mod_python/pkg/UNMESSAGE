To completely uninstall this package you need to remove the following
line from ${SYSCONFDIR}/apache2/httpd2.conf

	LoadModule python_module ${PREFIX}/lib/apache2/mod_python.so

And revert the HTTPD line of ${PREFIX}/sbin/apachectl2 to:

	HTTPD='/usr/local/sbin/httpd2'

Do not do this if you plan on re-installing this package at some future
time.
