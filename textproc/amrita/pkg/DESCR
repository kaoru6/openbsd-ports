amrita -  a html/xhtml template library for Ruby

Amrita is a a html/xhtml template library for Ruby. 
It makes html documents from a template and a model data.

Key feature

* The template for amrita is a pure html/xhtml document without no
  special tag like <?...?> or <% .. %>

* The template can be written by designers using almost any HTML
  Editor.

* Need no change on Ruby code to change the view of _dynamic_ part
  (not only static part) of the template

* The model data may be standard Ruby data, Hash, Array, String... or
  an instance of a classes you made.

* The output is controlled by _data_ not by logic. So It's easy to
  write, test, debug code. (Good for eXtreamPrograming)

* HTML template can be compiled into Ruby code before execution
  with a little effort.

Amrita mixes a template and model data up to a html document naturally
matching the +id+ attribute of HTML element to model data.
